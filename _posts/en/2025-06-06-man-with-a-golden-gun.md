# Machinetools in movies – The Man with the Golden Gun

Something different this time – A scene from a movie classic: The Man with the Golden Gun from 1974

This scene does not look like a movie set, but as if it was filmed in a real shop rented for filming.  
Right on entry, we can see a Boley lathe:

</p>

When Roger Moores character is aiming down range, we can see a what appears to be a Deckel FP1 on the left and an Oxy-Fuel setup along with a forge in the middle of the frame.

</p>

A better view on the FP1 – It could also be an Alexander “Master Toolmaker” (https://www.lathes.co.uk/alexander/) since large parts of the movie where filmed in the UK and Alexander being a British Company making a copy of the Deckel FP1.

While getting some information from Lazar, the gunsmith played by Marne Maitland, we can also see an Excel No.2 die filer.
